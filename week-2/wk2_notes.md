# First principles 

What happens when you compile? In C when you type `make`

###Preprocessing 
goes into the library and gets what it needs

###Compiling 
assembly code is created from preprocessing - its a little closer to what the computer understands - this relates to moving things and usage of memory etc

###Assembling 
Assembling the above 

###Linking 
connects everything that has been assembled from the various libraries
