# Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the arts of programming CS50

### What is computer science

Computer science is about problem solving. It is portrayed as something that is anti-social and steeped in code. But that is not really what it is about. 

### What is abstraction?

This is not a level that is useful conceptually to think about. Baisically you take fairly low level details and simplifying them so you can move on to something more interesting. 

* **Permute** - each of several possible ways in which a set or number of things can be ordered or arranged

* **Algorithms** - step by step instruction to solve a problem especially by a computer 

* **Pseudocode** - use english like syntax and express yourself succinctly 

* **Function** - is a specific step (an action you take) 

* **Conditions** - else, else if (branches or forks in the road) 

* **Boolean expression** - question that has a yes no answer or 1 - 0 answer 

* **Loop** - do something again, again and again 

* **Variables** - a value that can change based on conditions 

* **Threads** - multiple things at once

* **Events** - listening 

* **Concatinate** - join two or more phrases 

* **Libraries** - low level code that others have written that you can use to get the job done

## Task

* Your project must have at least two sprites, at least one of which must resemble something other than a cat.
* Your project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
* Your project must use at least one condition, one loop, and one variable.
* Your project must use at least one sound.
* Your project should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in lecture (many of which, though instructive, were quite short) but it can be less complex than Ivyâ€™s Hardest Game. As such, your project should probably use a few dozen puzzle pieces overall.

## Idea 

A little bat that loves bad food, but needs to watch his weight. 

* The little bat must avoid the donuts and try and get the bananas within the timeframe without losing all his life 
* Everytime he hits a donut he loses a point 
* Everytime he hits the bananas he gains a point 
* When he loses something bad happens - He dies?
* When he wins something good happens - He lives


### Sprites (must have atleast 3)
* bat 1
* bananas (good)
* donut (bad)


#### Scripts (must have atleast 3 total)

* 1 condition - forks in the road (the different choices of food he eats)
* 1 loop - do something again, again and again (he gets offered food again and again till he reaches 10)
* 1 variable - a value that can change based on conditions (his points when he eats good or bad food)
* 1 sound - audible noise (he gets a piggy sound when he eats a bad thing, and a fairy dust sound when he eats a good thing)
